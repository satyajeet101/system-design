## kafka
- Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. 
- It is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data streams and is widely used for various use cases such as messaging, log aggregation, and event sourcing. 
- It also supports stream processing with the Kafka Streams API.
## Broker
- A Kafka Broker is a server that stores and manages Kafka topics and partitions. 
- It is responsible for receiving, storing, and serving messages to producers and consumers. 
- A Kafka cluster typically consists of multiple brokers to ensure fault tolerance and scalability.
## Partition
- A Kafka Partition is a division of a Kafka topic that allows for parallelism and scalability. 
- Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages that is continually appended to. 
- Partitions enable Kafka to distribute data across multiple brokers, allowing for high throughput and fault tolerance.
## Topic
- A Kafka Topic is a logical channel for organizing and categorizing messages in Apache Kafka. 
- Topics are used to group related messages together, allowing producers to send messages to specific topics and consumers to subscribe to topics of interest. 
- Topics can have multiple partitions to enable parallel processing and scalability.
## Main Topic
- A Main Topic in Kafka refers to the primary topic where messages are produced and consumed. 
- It is the central channel for data flow in a Kafka-based application, serving as the main source of information for producers and consumers. 
- The Main Topic is typically the focus of data processing and analysis.
## Retry Topic
- A Retry Topic in Kafka is a special topic used to temporarily store messages that failed to be processed by consumers. 
- When a message processing fails, it is sent to the Retry Topic for later reprocessing, allowing for retries without losing the original message. 
- Retry Topics help improve the reliability and fault tolerance of Kafka-based applications.
## DLQ Topic
- A DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) Topic in Kafka is a special topic used to store messages that cannot be processed successfully after multiple retries. 
- When a message fails to be processed after a certain number of attempts, it is sent to the DLQ Topic for further investigation or manual intervention. 
- DLQ Topics help ensure that problematic messages do not block the processing of other messages in the main topic.
## Retention Ms
- Retention Ms in Kafka refers to the duration (in milliseconds) for which messages are retained in a Kafka topic before they are deleted. 
- This configuration setting allows administrators to control how long messages are stored in the topic, balancing storage requirements with data availability. 
- Once the retention period expires, messages are automatically removed from the topic.
## Retention byte
- Retention Byte in Kafka refers to the maximum size (in bytes) of data that can be stored in a Kafka topic before older messages are deleted. 
- This configuration setting allows administrators to control the storage capacity of a topic, ensuring that it does not exceed a specified limit. 
- Once the size limit is reached, older messages are automatically removed to make room for new messages.
## Producer
- A Kafka Producer is a client application that sends messages to Kafka topics. 
- Producers are responsible for serializing messages and determining the appropriate topic and partition for each message. 
- Kafka Producers can be configured for various delivery guarantees, such as at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once semantics.
## Batch Message Producer
- A Batch Message Producer in Kafka is a type of producer that groups multiple messages together into a single batch before sending them to the Kafka broker. 
- This approach improves throughput and reduces network overhead by minimizing the number of requests sent to the broker. 
- Batch Message Producers can be configured with various batch sizes and timeouts to optimize performance.
## Compress Message Producer
- A Compress Message Producer in Kafka is a type of producer that compresses messages before sending them to the Kafka broker. 
- Compression reduces the size of messages, leading to lower network bandwidth usage and improved storage efficiency. 
- Kafka supports various compression algorithms, such as GZIP, Snappy, and LZ4, which can be configured for the producer.
## Consumer
- A Kafka Consumer is a client application that reads messages from Kafka topics. 
- Consumers subscribe to one or more topics and process the messages they receive. 
- Kafka Consumers can be configured to work in consumer groups, allowing for parallel processing and load balancing.
## Consumer Group
- A Kafka Consumer Group is a collection of Kafka consumers that work together to consume messages from one or more topics. 
- Each consumer in the group is assigned a subset of partitions from the subscribed topics, allowing for parallel processing and load balancing. 
- Consumer groups enable fault tolerance, as if one consumer fails, another can take over its partitions.
## Commit Offset
- Committing an offset in Kafka refers to the process of saving the position of a consumer within a topic partition. 
- When a consumer processes messages, it keeps track of the last offset it has successfully processed. 
- Committing offsets allows consumers to resume processing from the last committed position in case of failures or restarts.
## Worker
- A Worker in Kafka refers to a processing unit or thread that handles the consumption and processing of messages from Kafka topics. 
- Workers are typically part of a consumer application and are responsible for executing the business logic associated with the messages they consume. 
- Multiple workers can be used to increase parallelism and throughput in message processing.
## ACKS
- ACKS (Acknowledgments) in Kafka is a configuration setting for producers that determines the level of acknowledgment required from the Kafka broker before considering a message as successfully sent. 
- The ACKS setting can be configured to "0" (no acknowledgment), "1" (leader acknowledgment), or "all" (all replicas acknowledgment), affecting message durability and reliability.
## Replication Factor
- The Replication Factor in Kafka is a configuration setting that determines the number of copies (replicas) of each partition that are maintained across different brokers in a Kafka cluster. 
- A higher replication factor increases fault tolerance and data availability, as it allows the system to continue functioning even if some brokers fail. 
- The replication factor is set at the topic level and can be adjusted based on the desired level of redundancy.
## kafka-connect
- Kafka Connect is a tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems. 
- It provides a framework for building and running connectors that can ingest data from various sources into Kafka topics or export data from Kafka topics to external systems. 
- Kafka Connect supports both source connectors (for importing data into Kafka) and sink connectors (for exporting data from Kafka).
## kafka-connector
- Kafka Connector is a framework for building and running connectors that integrate Apache Kafka with external systems.
- It provides a standardized way to move data into and out of Kafka topics, enabling seamless data integration.
- Kafka Connector supports both source connectors (for importing data into Kafka) and sink connectors (for exporting data from Kafka).
## kafka-mirror-maker
- Kafka MirrorMaker is a tool for replicating data between Apache Kafka clusters. 
- It is used to create a copy of data from one Kafka cluster to another, enabling data redundancy, disaster recovery, and geo-replication. 
- MirrorMaker consumes data from topics in the source cluster and produces it to corresponding topics in the target cluster.
